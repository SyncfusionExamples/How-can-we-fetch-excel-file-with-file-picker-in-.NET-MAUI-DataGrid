In this article, we will show you how can we fetch a excel file with file picker and import data into the [.Net Maui DataGrid](https://www.syncfusion.com/maui-controls/maui-datagrid).

## C#
The below code illustrates how to fetch a excel file with file picker and import data into the DataGrid.
```
    void Import_Clicked(System.Object sender, System.EventArgs e)
    {
        LoadDataGridAsync();
    }

    private async Task LoadDataGridAsync()
    {
        //Creates a new instance for ExcelEngine
        ExcelEngine excelEngine = new ExcelEngine();

        //Initialize IApplication
        Syncfusion.XlsIO.IApplication application = excelEngine.Excel;


        var customFileType = new FilePickerFileType(
            new Dictionary<DevicePlatform, IEnumerable<string>>
            {
                // iOS: using Uniform Type Identifiers (UTIs)
                { DevicePlatform.iOS, new[] { "public.data" } }, 

                // Android: using MIME types
                { DevicePlatform.Android, new[] { "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet" } }, 

                // Windows: using file extensions
                { DevicePlatform.WinUI, new[] { ".xlsx" } }, 
            });

        PickOptions pickOptions = new PickOptions()
        {
            PickerTitle = "Please select DataGrid file",
            FileTypes = customFileType,
        };

        var result = await FilePicker.Default.PickAsync(pickOptions);
        if (result != null)
        {
            //Load the file into stream
            Stream inputStream = await result.OpenReadAsync();

            //Loads or open an existing workbook through Open method of IWorkbooks
            IWorkbook workbook = excelEngine.Excel.Workbooks.Open(inputStream);

            IWorksheet worksheet = workbook.Worksheets[0];

            DataTable customersTable = worksheet.ExportDataTable(1, 1, 10, 6, ExcelExportDataTableOptions.ColumnNames);

            this.dataGrid.ItemsSource = customersTable;

            workbook.Close();
        }

        excelEngine.Dispose();
    }
```
